# Viper Development Client Onboarding

## Initial Project Documentation

We believe that in order to create successful projects, we need to align in terms of expectations and desired results. In order to do that, please write along the following points so we can have a better initial understanding of what you are trying to build.

## 1. Your goals and your vision

We offer a variety of services and have worked on the path of creating digital products, sometimes from end to end or sometimes just consulting on designs, technology, business model and so on. What we do is that we work with you to understand what drives you to create this product - things like client validation, first users onboarding, a/b testing ,etc. - and we make this happen by combining our business acumen with technology, design and great user experience. We usually offer three standard packages, those being design, MVP of the product and we even build larger iterations - such as more established products, more advanced MVPs, etc., 

Typically, a product involves understanding the business, going through and understanding the solution, wireframing & design and Agile development, done in sprints. So we would like to know if you would like us to assist you from start to end or maybe intervene just at some point in this process. 

**What do you want to achieve with this project?**

e.g. validate product, improve an existing product, add new features to an existing product, etc

## 2. Objective

It is always good to start with the project’s objective and to clearly define that. Here, what we are interested goes along these lines:

1. What problem is your problem trying to fix? 
2. What solution are you proposing to solve that problem?
3. What makes your solution unique?
4. What does your solution consist of? – mobile app, web app, both, etc

**Client:**


## 3. Features

Here it is important to define what you would like the app or the user to be able to do. We believe it is better to define actions instead of features because usually there are more ways to do an action, so we have the freedom to come with different UX designs and different ways of doing what you want.

Helpful when you document features:

1. Usage scenarios or use cases
2. Describe the action clearly, showing what is expected of the user/app
3. Do not focus on design, that comes at a later stage
4. Give references, whenever possible 
– e.g. I would like to have the ability to post messages and replies on a message board, similar to reddit (link)
5. Think and tell of what you like and what you don’t 
– e.g. I want to be able to upload documents as in wetransfer, but I don’t want like to be restricted to upload only photos as in my app

## 4. Timeframe

**Do you have a timeframe in mind?**

Are you building a product for a competition? Are you part of an accelerator and want an MVP to present at a Demo Day? Do you want everything done quickly because it is for a big client?

We would be working in sprints and staying in touch and showing what we do along the way, but it is important for us to know exactly what your timeframe is so we can organize our product strategy and sprints and cater for your needs in time.
