# The client onboarding process

### Why have an automated onboarding process
* Automation looks like you have done this before
* Automation saves time
* Automation gives client a better experience
* It still allows you to feel personal and implies a certain level of client service even if you are busy

Should be automated & ready when we begin:
1. Contract

2. Give clients homework to do:
    - collect inspiration - a board on Dropmark can help - clients can save any websites and designs they find interesting
    - Worksheets - questions about business, designs/website preferences, etc
    - files we need from the client, if any - vector logo, brand guidelines, etc
    
3. Give clients an area of your website to access their files - as it proves to be with Ralf, we need to set up some deployment facilities and maybe a google drive folder for each client where they can upload stuff, see it, etc

### Weekly/iteration update to client - regurlarly
1. Where we are
2. What are we going to do this week/iteration
3. What we need from the client
4. Feedback on the last completed iteration

### What to do after a project finishes

* Contact the client 1 month after project ended and offer for free 1h development as there might have been small things that have been missed

* Get feedback and most importantly - a testimonial
It is always better to transform feedback into a testimonial than ask people for a testimonial.

Testimonial ideas: 
**could be named viperdev stories** 
**can be shown on the viperdev page as bold quotes over images -- modern webdesign**
**refer to customers as friends**

Areas to check for feedback/testimonial - through typeform
1. What was the need they had before they came to viperdev?
2. Had they previously tried anything else to solve their problem? If so, what? - i.e. have they worked with anyone else? What was the problem there?
3. What was the result of the collaboration with viperdev? Did it achieve expectations, timeframes and the way of working expected?
4. What was the best thing about it?
5. What are three other benefits that theyâ€™ve enjoyed?
6. What would they say to anyone considering working with viperdev and would they recommend it? If so, why?
7. Name one thing you would have liked to be different

* Get project results some months after project has ended 
It will be much easier to sell going forward and to publish the results that we had with different MVPs and businesses - e.g. first 500 users, improved ROI, validated business idea, etc.

* Check later on with the client maybe some more work is needed :)
