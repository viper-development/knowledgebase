# What we would need on a client portal

### Project phases
* you must be able to split a project into phases and define for each phase the milestones/features to be implemented
* possibility to mark the phases as completed
* client can review/add comments to each milestone

organised as a list of phases that you can expand to see the milestones in each phase and how many are completed
UX: the phase you are currently working on is already expanded

### Team 
* a profile for each team member - developer, product/project manager, general business support (Lasse)
* each profile has occupation, email, phone number (if needed), timezone (important for calls for example)

It is important for the client to associate faces with the people, to know exactly who is working on what and to have the trust that comes with profiles and all that. 

### Bill area
Maybe here we can bill through a third party software and just show a list with the bills that have been recorded for that client, mark them as paid and show the total invested so far.
I believe financial transparency offers a sense of control and trust.

### Files area
Here we can have some folders and a clear split:
* contract
* invoices
* documents uploaded by the client
* files produced during the project - e.g. designs, notes, feedback, requirements, etc

### Meeting request*
* possibility to add a meeting request by either sides, needing confirmation from both to make communication less complicated

*nice to have
